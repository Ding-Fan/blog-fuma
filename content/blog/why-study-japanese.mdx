Because I want to know not only the meaning, but also the feeling of YUI's songs.

Because I feel the pronunciation in anime sounds cool. Naruto~ Sasuke~

Because there are so many good Japanese video games that I want to play in the original language. Especially galgames(visual novels). It's amazing to finish Stein's Gate in Japanese. My heart was trembling in the scene, I can feel the emotions in every tone of the serifs.

Because I want to know Japanese culture, Japanese people. Language can limit one's mindset. I want extension.

Because I want to understand the jokes and plots when chatting with Japanese friends in Japanese bar. I want to ツッコミ .

Because there are many nice Japanese teachers on Youtube.

Because I was born and raised in China, a country that has complicated historical relationship with Japan.

Because the Japanese society is polite but also oppressive. People in daily life always wearing masks hiding the real self, even little kids on stage. I want to know why, I want to see. I want to connect with Japanese people as a living person.

Because the more proficient I am in Japanese, the better I can work with Japanese, the more I can do in Japan.
