## Brewery Keg Tracking App Concept

### Core Concept
iOS app using LiDAR to scan brewery refrigerator rooms and create 3D maps for keg inventory management. Target users: brewery staff who need to efficiently locate and track kegs in cold storage environments.

### Key Features

#### LiDAR 3D Scanning
- Initial room scan to create accurate 3D model of refrigerator storage space
- Periodic re-scans to update layout changes
- Precision tracking for stacked and multi-level keg storage

#### Manual Area Division System
Suggested zone categories for brewery operations:
- **By Beer Type**: IPA section, Lager section, Stout section, etc.
- **By Status**: Full kegs, Tapped kegs, Empty (ready for pickup)
- **By Batch/Date**: FIFO inventory management zones
- **By Temperature**: Different climate zones if applicable

#### QR Code Integration
Each keg has QR code containing:
- Empty weight and volume specifications
- Keg ID and manufacturer details
- Link to dynamic inventory data

#### Registration & Tracking System
**Keg Check-In Process:**
- Scan QR code to register keg
- Log contents (beer type, ABV, batch number)
- Record pricing information
- Assign to storage zone on 3D map
- Set delivery/brewing date

**Keg Check-Out Process:**
- Scan QR code for identification
- Update status (tapped, empty, returned)
- Log removal date and destination
- Update 3D map location

#### Search & Navigation
- "Find [Beer Name]" - highlights location on 3D map
- Filter by status, type, date ranges
- Visual path finding to specific kegs
- Inventory alerts for low stock or expired products

### User Journey Considerations
1. **Initial Setup**: Full room LiDAR scan and zone definition
2. **Daily Operations**: Quick keg registration and location updates
3. **Inventory Management**: Visual browsing of 3D map for stock checking
4. **Order Fulfillment**: Efficient keg location for bar/restaurant delivery

### Technical Requirements
- iPhone 12 Pro or newer (LiDAR capability)
- Integration with existing brewery management systems
- Offline functionality for cold storage environments
- Export capabilities for inventory reports
