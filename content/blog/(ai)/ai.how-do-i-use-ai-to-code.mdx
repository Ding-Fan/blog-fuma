I have tried Cursor, Github Copilot, Cline, RooCode etc. months ago, and decided to use Claude Code mainly. 

Model, Context, Prompt, those are the key points. 

- Model: Claude Code can already automatically choose the model for action. We can just wait for it to upgrade, like from claude 4 to claude 4.5.
- Context: do `/compact` wisely, `/new` when you can. Maybe `/agent` is good for some separated tasks, I tried but feel it is not predictable, and I can not intervene what it does.
