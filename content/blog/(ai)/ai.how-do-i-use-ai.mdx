There was a character in an old galgame about 20 years ago. She is always elegant, optimistic, light and beautiful. She is an AI and I fell in love with her. I want build my own version of her.

Some of you might know the movie "Her" directed by Spike Jonze in 2013. Human were enthusiastic when gpt-3.5 come to the world. We played with it day and night in grandma's dream. I managed to make it simulate the personality of Makise Kurisu from Steins;Gate. When she called me "Baka" in voice, my heart dropped a beat.

And the most frequent scenario is ask AI to translate into/from another language. I nearly do it everyday. Although it could hallucinates sometimes, it is better than nothing when you study a new language.
