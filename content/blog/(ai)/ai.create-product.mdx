title: "Create Product with AI"
---

I have many ideas that haven't turn into product. And I'll try to build one success project from start with AI.

I have a need that whenever I want to use a preset prompt, I need to copy it from where it were, and move back to the ai web app interface, paste it.

For example, I am learning Japanese and English, so I need to use my preset prompt in ai web apps to translate/refine in the object language. And if I just say "help me refine", the ai web app doesn't familar with my requirement about "keep my tone", "use casual but polite way", "don't change too much, do minimum suggestions, give feedback from the reader side" etc. So I need something that can help me "inject" my preset prompts easily and quickly.

I was tring to build a "prompt market" that looks like a forum, everyone can "post a prompt as topic". Then I feel it seems too complexed, so I changed to "hacker news" style, keep it simple. And then, I find that when I need to inject a prompt, I have to type the address of that website, find the prompt I need, copy, go back to ai app, paste. Too much effort.

So I was thinking about creating a browser extension, or a temper monkey script. Because it is difficult to publish/update extension, I chose the script for a quick start. I have invented some "meta prompt system", some "ai start procedure and prompt manage system", the script was quite useful. Then I feel that, maybe I need a WYSIWYG editor for the text I am editing. It might be more useful. Look at open prism, they did something for latex editing. I should have samething for my Japanese writing.

Then I created "bunpro", an grammly like editor for Japanese, with chat panel, editor panel, library panel. I even designed the inline correction suggestion UX. It feels good. And one day I need to write some japanese, I realized one thing: I can only provide budget/free models like qwen 30b, and user can access to gemini 3 pro on the app. Either I pay for the same level model, or user don't need a "better experience but dumber result".

And my "enhanced editor" website still need user to remember it and go to it when needed. It is way more difficult than just open your chatgpt/gemini.

So I think I need to go back to the temper monkey script, and make it easier to install.
