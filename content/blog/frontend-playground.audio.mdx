Have you ever run into a webpage and it plays audio?

<audio src="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/audio.mp3" controls></audio>

> The `<audio>` HTML element is used to embed sound content in documents. 
>
> --[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/audio)

Here is the code for it:

```html title="index.html" copy
<audio
    src="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/audio.mp3"
    controls
></audio>
```

Try to copy and paste it in this [playground](https://codepen.io/neon/pen/qEbVZWL) 

- `<audio></audio>`: The audio element. 
  - `<` is the opening angle bracket.
  - `>` is the closing angle bracket.
  - `<audio>` is the opening tag.
  - `</audio>` is the closing tag. Look, there is a `/` 

- `src="..."`: The <span className='text-red-600'>s</span>ou<span className='text-red-600'>rc</span>e **attribute**. It tells the browser where to find the audio file. 
  - See, this is the **key value pair pattern** .
    - The key is `src`
    - The value is `"https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/audio.mp3"`

- `controls`: This **attribute** tells the browser to show the default audio controls (play, pause, volume, etc.). It doesn't need a value. Just having it there is enough.

What if we want to create a button to play the audio?

```html
<button id="playButton">Play Audio</button>
```

- `<button></button>`: The ____ element. 
  - `<` is the ____ angle bracket.
  - `>` is the ____.
  - `<button>` is the ____ tag.
  - `</button>` is the ____. Look, there is a `/` 
  - `id="playButton"`: The ____ attribute. It gives the button an id of "playButton". 
    - See, this is the ____ pattern.
      - The ____ is `id`
      - The ____ is `"playButton"`

```html title="index.html" copy
<!-- Put this in the HTML section -->

<button id="playButton">Play Audio</button>
<audio
    id="myAudio"
    src="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/audio.mp3"
    controls
></audio>
```

You can see the button beside the audio controls, and if you click the button, NOTHING HAPPENS! NOTHING HAPPENS! NOTHING, HAPPENS!

```js title="index.js" copy lineNumbers
// Put this in the JS section

// From the HTML document
// we get an element by its id
// the id is playButton
// and we store it in a constant variable
// called playButton
const playButton = document.getElementById('playButton');

// From the HTML document, we get an element by its id myAudio
// and we store it in constant variable myAudio
const myAudio = document.getElementById('myAudio');

// We add an event listener to the playButton
// The event listener listens for a 'click' event
// When the button is clicked, it runs a function
playButton.addEventListener('click', function() {

    // call the play method on the myAudio element
    myAudio.play();
});
```

> The `HTMLMediaElement play()` method attempts to begin playback of the media.

You can see and hear that audio plays when you click the Play Audio button.

What if we want to play the audio starting from 0 every time we click the button?

> The `HTMLMediaElement` interface's `currentTime` property specifies the current playback time in seconds.
>
> Changing the value of `currentTime` seeks the media to the new time.
>
> --[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/currentTime)

```js title="index.js"
... // rest of the code is the same

playButton.addEventListener('click', function() {

    myAudio.currentTime = 0; // Set the current time to 0 // [!code ++]
    myAudio.play();
});
```

What if we want to hide the default audio controls? Just remove the `controls` attribute.

Don't click the Play Audio button yet! Because...

```html title="index.html" 
<audio id="myAudio" src="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/audio.mp3" controls ></audio> <!-- [!code --] -->

<audio id="myAudio" src="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/audio.mp3" ></audio> <!-- [!code ++] -->
``` 

Now you don't have a pause button! You have to wait for the audio play to the end...or refresh the page.

Why don't you try to create a Pause Audio button?

> The `HTMLMediaElement.pause()` method will pause playback of the media, if the media is already in a paused state this method will have no effect.
>
> --[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/pause)

```html title="index.html"
<button id="pauseButton">Pause Audio</button> <!-- [!code ++] -->
```

```js title="index.js"
const pauseButton = document.getElementById('pauseButton'); // [!code ++]

pauseButton.addEventListener('click', function() { // [!code ++]
    myAudio.pause(); // [!code ++]
}); // [!code ++]
```


<div className='pb-80'></div>


THE END
