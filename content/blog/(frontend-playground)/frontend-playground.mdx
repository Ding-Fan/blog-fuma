## Welcome to Frontend Playground

If you are already comfortable with editor/IDE, use them. If not, use online playgrounds like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

In this tutorial, we will create a simple self-introduction webpage.


Do you know `<p>`?

`<p>` is the HTML tag for paragraph.

In HTML, usually use lowercase letter in tag name.
























In the HTML area, input the following code:

```html title="index.html" copy
<h1>My name is YUI</h1>
```

Now you see The Most Basic Pattern in HTML: Tag

## The Most Basic Pattern in HTML: Tag



```html
<h1>My name is YUI</h1>
```

- open tag: `<h1>`
- content: `My name is YUI`
- close tag: `</h1>`

Now, try to read this code aloud:

```html
<p>I'm a foreign student in Japan.</p>
```

- open tag: `<h1>`
  - open angle bracket: `<`
  - tag name: `h1`
  - close angle bracket: `>`
- content: `My name is YUI`
- close tag: `</h1>`
  - open angle bracket: `<`
  - forward slash: `/`
  - tag name: `h1`
  - close angle bracket: `>`

Open tag p, content is I'm a foreign student in Japan., close tag p.

Look at the open tag and close tag, what is the big difference?

The close tag has a forward slash `/` right after the opening angle bracket `<`. That's it!
