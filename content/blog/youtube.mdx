- [How to introduce yourself—and get hired | Rebecca Okamoto | TEDxNorthwesternU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_N3PGvnVKg)
  - First impressions matter! A great introduction can be a powerful door opener to new possibilities. However, with today’s split-second attention spans, you may only have seconds to turn your introduction into a career or business building opportunity. If you dread answering “Tell me about yourself” or struggle to explain what makes you unique, join Rebecca Okamoto. You’ll learn step-by-step how to introduce yourself perfectly in 20 words or less and leave a lasting, positive impression. 
  - Rebecca is a communication and personal brand consultant, and the founder of Evoke Strategy Group. She helps professionals communicate, align, and influence at higher levels, specializing in coaching managers to present complex ideas to senior stakeholders. A former Procter & Gamble supply chain leader and the first Asian American woman to lead supply chains in the US and Asia, she now works with corporations and nonprofits to help leaders showcase their strategic thinking and elevate their executive presence.
